# JSON to HTML table

This JavaScript utility accepts JSON data with one level and converts it into an easy to read HTML table. You can also sort the table by clicking on the column header. For this, all you need to do is either paste a JSON URL into the textbox, or paste a JSON data directly into the textbox or choose a JSON data file from your hard disk.
